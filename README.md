# Xflows - An Open source automatic Time Tracker

Focus.io, An open source AI Automatic Time tracking software that helps students, knowledge workers spend their digital time productive & Efficient and It lets the users to create group & compare screen time & activities to add an extra layer of accountability.

## Why I build Focus.io?
	- Attention span is all-time low, short-form content making it even worser.
	- checked tools out there, No tools provide end-to-end solution & rize.io looks better BUT IT's PROPERIATORY & Cost $156/year. 
	- So I built Focuz! 


"My mission is to create the experience of the flow State(xflows) on every working hours"
